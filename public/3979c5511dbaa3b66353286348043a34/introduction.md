# Behind The Website
**I created this site with a vision of transforming what already exists:** 
<ul style="margin-top: -16px">
  <li>There are online textbooks and guides, but they feel stiff and leave questions to be answered.</li>
  <li>There are courses and content, but they are hidden behind paywalls. </li>
  <li>There are downloadables, but they aren't organized and easy to find.</li>
</ul>

I wanted to provide students with a hub to provide resource that *costs nothing* and *doesn't leave you with more questions*. 

<!-- I hope that this site is everything you need it to be. If you have an idea of how I can make this site even better, shoot it my way:

# Navigating the Site

As you may have noticed, content is split by course. 

# Need More?

For some, this site might not be enough. I offer LIVE group and individual online sessions every week to help students achieve success in mathematics. For more information, [click here](/tutoring).

```javascript

The $\boldsymbol{p}\textbf{-Series Test}$ states that:

- If $p>1$, the $p$-series $\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^p}$ converges
- If $0<p \leq 1$, the $p$-series $\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^p}$ diverges
